In particle physics, accurate jet tagging plays a crucial role, enabling the identification of events originating
from different physical processes; a wide range of Deep Neural Network (DNN) approaches have been explored for this task. 
The current state of the art is represented by ParT, a transformer-based model. 

Recently, the **xLSTM architecture has been introduced**, a redesigned recurrent neural network that achieves performance comparable to, 
in some tasks even surpassing, transformer models in natural language modeling.
In this work **we present**, to the best of our knowledge, **the first application of xLSTM to jet tagging**, focusing on the
isolation of **top-quark events**. We describe the architecture and evaluate its performance on established jet tagging benchmarks,
comparing it against simpler LSTM-based baselines. 
For this binary classification, the xLSTM JetTagger does not outperform
standard LSTM architectures. Further work is needed to assess
whether the architectureâ€™s potential can be fully exploited on
the more complex problem of multi-class jet tagging, which is
of particular interest for low-level trigger systems.
